/*
passwordConfirmation validation: As far as I know Yup doesnâ€™t have anything like equals method to compare two strings. We need to compare passwordConfirmation value with array values oneOf(array, 'Error message') where array is array with only one value from values object values.password.
consent validation: Yup also doesnâ€™t have method to check whether value is true or false. We need to use test method which takes 3 params. The first is name of the validation (I donâ€™t know why ðŸ¤”), the second is error message and the third is our custom validation function
