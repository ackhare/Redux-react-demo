We will build a React Application using React Router v4 and Redux. 
It can get App state data and display them in a Component:

– AppRouter for implementing React Router.
– DashBoard, AddBook, EditBook, Help, NotFound are React Components that will work with Router.

– BookList Component is a child Component of DashBoard. In this Component, we use react-redux connect() 
function. Then props that is gotten from state will be used in Book Component – child of BookList Component.

– We will use react-redux Provider inside app.js.
In app.js

-  get store.
– dispatch addBook action after every second (we want to check if Component props is updated whenever 
state changes).
– use react-redux Provider to make Redux store available for connecting with React Components.


To summarize Flow of events 

1)first of all we initiale 3 books object with dispatch which will get to action and store in store object 
2)Then through proper route it will go to dashboard and then its child Booklist where we will 
  fill its props with some object from store via mapstateToProps where we will return a props object via 
  state tree of object(books)
3)Next a loop will be done on the props to take and list book object there which will be shown to audience
  though {props.books.map}
