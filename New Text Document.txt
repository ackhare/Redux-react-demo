We will build a React Application using React Router v4 and Redux. 
It can get App state data and display them in a Component:

– AppRouter for implementing React Router.
– DashBoard, AddBook, EditBook, Help, NotFound are React Components that will work with Router.

– BookList Component is a child Component of DashBoard. In this Component, we use react-redux connect() 
function. Then props that is gotten from state will be used in Book Component – child of BookList Component.

– We will use react-redux Provider inside app.js.
In app.js

-  get store.
– dispatch addBook action after every second (we want to check if Component props is updated whenever 
state changes).
– use react-redux Provider to make Redux store available for connecting with React Components.
